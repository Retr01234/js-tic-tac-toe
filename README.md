## Design

### Colour Scheme

![JavaScript Tic-Tac-Toe Website Colour Palette](/assets/images/palette.jpg)

This website uses a street wall type of theme, with red exposed brick and neat graffiti.

### Typography

The one and only font used for this website is 'fantasy'.

### Imagery

All images are taken from licence free stock photo website's which will be linked in the [credits](#Credits) section.

### Features

This website is a Single-Page Application that has only one page and 1 Main section.

- The page has:
  - A Header with a title to tell people what this game is and to add some structure to the site.
  - The Main Section which is the most important part and main focus of the website and that is: Tic Tac Toe Game-

### Accessibility

I paid good attention to detail to design by making it as easy to navigate as possible and keeping it straight to the point. This was done by:

- Using structured Semantic HTML
- There was good design and styling for such simple application
- Keeping all styles consistent throughout all Devices.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Git - Version control.

Github - To create and save my codebase.

SweetAlert - JavaScript Library to show better Browser Alerts.

## Testing

Testing was done constantly before and after pushing new changes to the master branch. However, during the production of this project, me and my Mentor were not able to find any REAL faults. Of course, there were some suggestions such as:

- Change the Font Style from 'Rubik Spray Paint' to something more easier to read.
- Use a JavaScript Library such as "Sweet Alert" to display better and faster Browser Alerts.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.
